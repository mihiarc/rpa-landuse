## Key Findings

> **The RPA Assessment analyzes the potential effects of global and national trends on all U.S. forest and rangelands over the next 50 years.**

> **A carefully selected set of scenarios, defining and integrating plausible future climate, population, and economic conditions, are used to organize projection work.**

> **All resource areas (e.g., forests, water, recreation, and wildlife) use the same set of scenarios or a subset (e.g., climate only) to define a plausible range of natural resource availability and condition over a 50-year period, establishing a consistent and coordinated approach.**

> **The downscaled projections of socioeconomic and climatic change developed from the scenarios can be used alongside RPA resource projections to inform planning, strategic thinking, and policy deliberation about the future for natural resource management and policy needs.**

## Overview

The 2020 RPA Assessment uses scenarios to explore alternative futures and provide a framework for evaluating a plausible range of future resource outcomes. These scenarios integrate both climate and socioeconomic factors to project natural resource conditions over a 50-year horizon through 2070.

### Chapter Organization
- Framing the RPA Assessment scenarios
- Climate scenarios and projections
- Socioeconomic scenarios and projections
- Four integrated RPA scenarios
- Application to natural resource sectors
- COVID-19 implications

## Framing the RPA Assessment Scenarios

### Purpose and Approach
- **Scenarios explore alternative futures** rather than predict a single outcome
- **Particularly useful** when considerable uncertainty exists about driving forces
- **Globally linked approach** recognizes that global conditions increasingly affect domestic resources
- **IPCC framework adopted** - scenarios represent plausible futures without assigned likelihoods

### Key Principles
- Scenarios are **not predictions** but plausible alternative futures
- Enable systematic exploration of **uncertainty**
- Provide consistent framework across all resource analyses
- Support strategic thinking about natural resource management

## The Four 2020 RPA Scenarios

The RPA Assessment uses four integrated scenarios combining climate (RCP) and socioeconomic (SSP) pathways:

## Linking Scenarios to Natural Resource Sectors

### Application Framework
Different resource analyses use different combinations of scenario variables:

#### **Direct Climate and Socioeconomic Integration**
- Land use and land cover change
- Water resources
- Recreation demand
- Wildlife habitat

#### **Climate-Only Applications**
- Forest productivity
- Wildfire risk
- Species distribution
- Watershed function

#### **Socioeconomic-Only Applications**
- Timber markets
- Recreation participation

### Land Use as Intermediary
- **Critical link** between scenarios and resource outcomes
- **Integrates** climate and socioeconomic drivers
- **Provides spatial context** for resource analyses
- **Captures cumulative effects** of multiple drivers

## Using Scenarios in Resource Management Planning

### Time Horizon Considerations
- **Near-term (0-10 years)**: Limited divergence between scenarios
- **Mid-term (10-30 years)**: Increasing differentiation
- **Long-term (30-50 years)**: Maximum scenario divergence

### Regional Application Guidelines
- **Consider local context** when applying national projections
- **Evaluate all five climate projections** for regional planning
- **Account for uncertainty** in decision-making
- **Use scenarios to test** management strategy robustness

### The Five Core Climate Projections
1. **Least warm**: Lower bound of warming
2. **Hot**: Upper bound of warming
3. **Dry**: Reduced precipitation scenario
4. **Wet**: Increased precipitation scenario
5. **Middle**: Central tendency projection

## Conclusions

The 2020 RPA Assessment scenarios provide a comprehensive framework for understanding potential futures of America's forests and rangelands. By integrating climate and socioeconomic drivers, these scenarios:

- **Capture the range** of plausible future conditions
- **Enable consistent analysis** across resource sectors
- **Support strategic planning** under uncertainty
- **Facilitate integrated management** approaches

Success in managing natural resources over the coming decades will require:
- **Adaptive management** responsive to changing conditions
- **Cross-sector coordination** based on shared scenarios
- **Robust strategies** that perform well across multiple futures
- **Continuous monitoring** to track scenario realization

The scenarios remind us that the future is not predetermined but will be shaped by both global forces and local management decisions. By understanding the range of possible futures, resource managers can better prepare for uncertainty and work toward desired outcomes for America's forests and rangelands.
