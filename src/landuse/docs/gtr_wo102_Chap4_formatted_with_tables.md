## Overview

The land resources of the United States have experienced significant changes since the 2010 Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment, and continual change is expected in most landscapes because of both natural and human actions. This chapter summarizes recent trends of land use and land cover across the conterminous United States and presents future projections to 2070 based on RPA scenarios.

### Chapter Organization
- Historical changes in the land base
- Land cover changes and their effects on landscape patterns including forest fragmentation
- Land use projections under future scenarios
- Projected changes in impervious and tree covers and landscape patterns

### Geographic Scope
- Reports follow RPA regions (see Introduction Chapter, Figure 2-1)
- Excludes Alaska and Hawaii
- Additional details on forest and rangeland conditions in subsequent chapters

## Key Findings

### Land Development
> **Developed lands continue to encroach on natural ecosystems and agricultural areas, with about half of new developed lands converting from forest or rangeland.**

> **Developed lands are projected to continue to expand in all scenarios, although less than projected in the 2010 RPA Assessment. The expansion of developed lands varies across regions and is projected to be larger under high socioeconomic growth scenarios and smaller under hotter climate futures.**

### Forest Land Trends
> **Forest land area increased slightly over the past decades, mostly at the expense of pasture and crop land areas. This trend is expected to shift to decreasing forest area under all scenarios, although at lower rates than projected by the 2010 Assessment.**

### Forest Fragmentation
> **Forest cover fragmentation slowed over the past decade but continues overall and is expected to continue into the future for the western and southeastern subregions, while decreasing slightly in the north and central subregions.**

> **Changes in unfragmented forest land cover are more dynamic in private forests of the South, while changes in the West are slower and concentrated in public lands.**

### Landscape Context
> **Most forest lands remain in "natural" landscapes, but an increasing proportion is expected to be in "interface" landscapes near developed or agriculture use in the future.**

### Drivers of Change
> **Economic and regional factors tend to be more important drivers of land use area changes than changes in climatic conditions.**

## Historical Land Use and Land Cover

### Key Historical Findings

- **Developed lands** had the largest net increase of all land uses (1982-2012)
  - Forest and agriculture lands contributed about equally to new developed land
  - Crop lands had the largest decrease
- **Forest gains** from other land uses (primarily converted pasture) exceeded forest losses to other uses (mostly to developed)
  - Result: slight net increase in forest land area
- **Developed land expansion** rate:
  - **Increased**: 1982 to 1997
  - **Decreased**: 1997 to 2012
- **Land use vs. land cover** changes were broadly similar for agriculture and developed land, less so for forest land
  - Differences mostly due to temporary forest cover losses (harvest, wildfire) that didn't change forest land use

### Data Sources

The RPA land base analyses use four primary sources:
1. **USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)** - land use data
2. **USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service National Resources Inventory (NRI)** - non-Federal land use
3. **National Land Cover Database (NLCD)** - land cover data
4. **U.S. Census Bureau** - human demographics

### Key Definitions

**Land use** refers to the social and economic intent for which land is used, while **land cover** refers to the vegetation, exposed land surfaces, water, and artificial structures covering the land surface at a given time.

### National Resources Inventory Findings

#### Land Use Distribution (2012)
- **Forest land**: 411 million acres (26.8% of non-Federal land)
- **Rangeland**: 405 million acres (26.4%)

#### Net Changes (1982-2012)
- **Crop land**: -57 million acres (largest decline)
- **Developed land**: +42 million acres (largest increase)
- **Forest land**: Slight increase despite significant gross changes
  - Lost ~18 million acres to developed land
  - Gained ~20 million acres from pasture

### Urban Area Expansion

#### Population Trends
- **2010**: >80% of U.S. population in urban areas (up from 75% in 1990)
- **Urban area**: Increased from 2.1% (47 million acres) to 3.0% (68 million acres) of total land

#### State Rankings (2010)
**Largest urban area**:
- Texas: 5.6 million acres
- California: 5.3 million acres
- Florida: 4.7 million acres

**Highest percentage urban**:
- New Jersey: 39.8%
- Rhode Island: 38.7%
- Massachusetts: 38.0%

**Greatest urban growth (1990-2010)**:
- Nevada: 128.6%
- Delaware: 91.4%
- North Carolina: 87.8%

### Land Cover vs. Land Use Transitions

Comparisons revealed:
- **Average annual forest change rates (2001-2011)**:
  - Forest to nonforest: 0.26%
  - Nonforest to forest: 0.34%
  - Result: Slight net gain in forest land use
- **Forest cover change** differed from land use change due to temporary canopy disturbances
- **NLCD forest cover** experienced net loss while land use showed slight gain

## Projected Land Use

### Key Projections

- **Developed land**: Projected to increase across all scenarios
- **All non-developed land uses**: Projected to lose area
- **Most common conversion**: Forest land to developed land
- **Forest land decrease**: Projected under all scenarios (lower rates than 2010 Assessment)
- **Socioeconomic factors**: More influential than climate factors on land use change

### Land Use Change Model

#### Model Characteristics
- Projections for private land only
- County-level analysis for conterminous U.S.
- Time period: 2020-2070
- Based on 20 RPA scenario-climate futures
- Development assumed irreversible
- Policy-neutral projections

#### Historical Basis (2000-2012)
- Most active transitions between crop and pasture lands
- **Annual development rate**:
  - 1980s: ~1.2 million acres/year
  - 1992-1997: ~2.0 million acres/year
  - After 2000: Declining rate

- Assumes constant percent cover within land use classes
- Projects changes based on land use area changes
- Three representative scenarios analyzed:
  - **Average (HM-wet)**: Closest to mean change
  - **Maximum (HL-hot)**: Highest tree cover increase
  - **Minimum (HH-middle)**: Lowest tree cover increase

## Projected Land Use Patterns

### Key Pattern Projections

- **Landscape changes** strongly related to general land use area changes
- **New development** projected near existing development, nearly doubling developed-dominant land area
- **Interface changes**: Increased developed-natural interface, shift from agricultural-natural to developed-agricultural-natural
- **Consistency**: Pattern changes consistent across all 20 scenario-climate futures
- **Driver importance**: RPA scenarios > climate projections for human-modified landscapes; equal impact in less-modified areas
- **Forest contiguity**: Despite overall forest loss, more-contiguous forest projected in South Central, Northeast, and North Central Subregions

### Methodology

- County-level projections downscaled to 90m resolution
- 20 simulations per scenario-climate future
- Landscape patterns measured in 162-acre neighborhoods
- Classifications:
  - **Dominance**: ≥60% of neighborhood in one land use
  - **Interface**: ≥10% developed/agriculture in neighborhood
  - **Interior forest**: ≥90% forested neighborhood

**Note:** The median values do not necessarily sum to zero.

#### Interior Forest
- **Median change**: -1.5 million acres
- **Variability**: >25% of simulations showed increases
- Direction depends on climate and socioeconomic trends

### Climate Projection Effects

Comparing climate projections (aggregated across RPA scenarios):

#### Hot Climate Projection (most divergent)
- **Developed dominance**: 4.3 million acres less gain
- **Natural dominance**: 5.8 million acres less loss
- **Developed interface**: 3.2 million acres less gain
- **Interior forest**: Increase (vs. decrease in other projections)

#### Wet Climate Projection
- **Agriculture dominance**: 1.8 million acres more loss
- **Agriculture interface**: 2.2 million acres more loss

### RPA Scenario Effects

Comparing scenarios (aggregated across climate projections):

#### Economic Growth Impact (HH vs. HL)
- **High growth** adds:
  - 9.3 million acres developed-dominated land
  - 6.4 million acres above HM base
- **Interior forest loss**:
  - HH: 2.6 million acres
  - HL: 0.6 million acres (4x difference)

#### Warming Level Impact (LM vs. HM)
- Smaller effects than economic growth differences
- Similar patterns to HH scenario but reduced magnitude

### Regional Pattern Changes

#### Subregional Trends
- **Developed dominance**: Increases in all subregions
- **Agriculture dominance**: Decreases in all subregions
- **Natural dominance**: 
  - Decreases in most subregions
  - Increases in North Central and Great Plains
- **Interior forest**:
  - Increases: South Central, North Central, Northeast
  - Decreases: Southeast and western subregions

### Management Implications

Pattern projections suggest:
- Urban growth likely to expand existing urban areas
- New "urban interface" landscapes creating novel management pressures
- Need for "all-lands" and partnership management approaches
- Potential for forest consolidation in some regions despite overall loss

---

## Management Implications

### Land Use Change Drivers
- **Socioeconomic factors** currently more significant than climate drivers
- Economic considerations dominate forest land use decisions
- Climate change potential to become more important long-term
- Historical data may not capture future climate importance

### Ecosystem Service Valuation
- Current models consider only timber commodity values
- Additional ecosystem service values (carbon, water, wildlife) could:
  - Increase relative economic return to forest
  - Reduce forest conversion rates
  - Alter projected land use patterns

### Emerging Climate Challenges
Recent evidence suggests potential fundamental changes:
- **Western U.S.**: Prolonged extreme drought
- **Coastal regions**: Sea level rise impacts
- Traditional land uses may become unsustainable in some areas
- Geographic shifts in ecological service provision likely

### Future Research Needs
- Improved models addressing local climate-land use interactions
- Better integration of ecosystem service values
- Enhanced projections of climate impact thresholds
- Regional-scale adaptation planning tools

---

## Conclusions

### Historical Trends
- Total forest and woodland area relatively stable for decades
- Non-Federal forest showed slight gains (1982-2012)
- Forest cover declined ~3% (2001-2016)
- Differences explained by temporary cover loss and non-forest land uses

### Landscape Dynamics
- Forest resources highly dynamic over time and space
- Fragmentation changes often larger than net area changes suggest
- Short-term changes driven by:
  - Economic returns to agriculture and forest management
  - Temporary forest disturbances
- Changes pervasive on private land, less common on public lands

### Long-term Outlook
- **Most important lasting change**: Rural to urban land conversion
- **Primary driver**: Increasing population and relative economic returns
- **Future challenges**: 
  - Continued urbanization pressure
  - Climate change impacts on land use capacity
  - Need for adaptive management strategies
  - Integration of ecosystem service values in land use decisions

The future of America's land resources will depend on balancing economic development pressures with the need to maintain ecosystem services and adapt to changing climate conditions. Success will require innovative management approaches, improved valuation of ecosystem services, and recognition of emerging climate-related constraints on traditional land uses.
