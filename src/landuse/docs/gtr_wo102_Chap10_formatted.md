## Key Findings

> Biological diversity, or biodiversity, measures the variety of organisms and life forms in a specific area and is a key attribute of healthy ecosystems. Biodiversity naturally varies across the United States in response to geologic history, tectonic activity, and ecoregional characteristics, yet areas of the country with naturally lower biodiversity still support species of regional ecological, cultural, and commercial importance and provide important ecosystem services.

### Major Biodiversity Trends and Threats

- **Trends from breeding bird surveys indicate population declines in at least 20 percent of all bird species** across habitat types since the 1950s/60s, and in **more than 50 percent of species** that occupy grasslands or are ground nesting. These declines are linked to land use modifications of habitats as well as introduced species and loss of habitat connectivity.

- **Concentrations of imperiled taxa with a listing status under the Endangered Species Act** are found across the country, with particular concern in **Peninsular Florida and Hawaii for birds**, and in the **RPA North and South Regions for fishes, crayfish, and mussels**.

- **Watersheds of the RPA North and South Regions are most vulnerable** to compounded land use stress. Regardless of RPA region, **development stands out as the largest overall land use stressor** for native ecosystems.

- **Areas of potential high climate stress** were consistently found in mountainous areas of the RPA North, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Coast Regions, with pockets of stress identified in arid regions of the Rocky Mountain Region.

- **Federal lands with a lower risk of development or land conversion**, such as those managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and U.S. National Park Service, are projected to be under higher climate stress compared with other lands, potentially limiting their future ability to function as climate refugia for native biota.

## Patterns of Biodiversity

### Geographic Centers of Biodiversity

- **The Mississippi River basin and Madrean Sky Islands/U.S.-Mexico border areas** contain the highest terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity across the conterminous United States. These centers of biodiversity are linked to geologic history and the localized isolation of species (resulting in high rates of endemism).

### Bird Population Trends

- **Population trends in migratory game birds** (webless and waterfowl groups) since the 1950s/60s exhibit inter-annual variability, with harvest generally tracking overall population numbers. Over time:
  - Populations and harvest of **ducks and geese tend to be increasing**
  - **Woodcocks and mourning doves are declining**

- **Long-term population trends from breeding bird surveys** report statistically significant declines in all groups of breeding birds, with **at least half of all species of grassland or ground-nesting species showing significant population declines**.

## Aquatic Biodiversity

**Table 10-1.** Native aquatic biodiversity and species endemic to each RPA region for fish, crayfish, and mussels. Numbers are species richness counts, with the number of endemic species in parentheses.

| RPA Region | Combined Biodiversity | Fish | Crayfish | Mussels |
|------------|---------------------|------|----------|---------|
| | *Total biodiversity (total endemic)* |
| **North** | 560 (63) | 354 (35) | 91 (24) | 115 (4) |
| **South** | 1,353 (855) | 702 (385) | 360 (293) | 291 (177) |
| **Rocky Mountain** | 342 (59) | 259 (57) | 18 (2) | 65 (0) |
| **Pacific Coast** | 127 (67) | 109 (63) | 10 (2) | 8 (2) |

### Key Aquatic Biodiversity Findings

- The **RPA South Region** contains the highest aquatic biodiversity with **1,353 total species** and **855 endemic species**
- **63 percent** of all endemic aquatic species are found in the South Region
- The South Region is particularly rich in:
  - Fish: **702 species** (385 endemic)
  - Crayfish: **360 species** (293 endemic)
  - Mussels: **291 species** (177 endemic)

| Least warm | MRI-CGCM3 | Meteorological Research Institute, Japan |
| Hot | HadGEM2-ES | Met Office Hadley Centre, United Kingdom |
| Dry | IPSL-CM5A-MR | Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, France |
| Wet | CNRM-CM5 | National Centre of Meteorological Research, France |
| Middle | NorESM1-M | Norwegian Climate Center, Norway |

*Each model was run under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.*

## Species at Risk

### Endangered Species Act Listings

Concentrations of imperiled taxa are distributed across the country:

- **Birds**: Highest concentrations in Peninsular Florida and Hawaii
- **Fishes**: Concentrated in the RPA North and South Regions
- **Crayfish**: Primarily in the RPA South Region
- **Mussels**: Concentrated in the RPA North and South Regions

### Population Decline Patterns

#### Breeding Birds
- **At least 20 percent** of all bird species show population declines since the 1950s/60s
- **More than 50 percent** of grassland species show significant declines
- **More than 50 percent** of ground-nesting species show significant declines

#### Habitat-Specific Declines
Greatest declines observed in:
1. **Grassland habitats**: Due to agricultural intensification and habitat loss
2. **Shrubland habitats**: From development and fire suppression
3. **Wetland habitats**: Despite conservation gains, still facing pressure

## Regional Vulnerability Assessment

### Land Use Stress
- **Highest vulnerability**: RPA North and South Regions' watersheds
- **Primary stressor**: Development (across all regions)
- **Secondary stressors**: Agriculture in the North and South; energy infrastructure in the Rocky Mountain Region

### Climate Stress
- **Mountainous areas**: Consistently high climate stress in North, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Coast Regions
- **Arid regions**: Pockets of high stress in the Rocky Mountain Region
- **Federal lands**: Projected to experience higher climate stress than other lands

### Compound Stress
Areas experiencing both high land use and climate stress:
- Southern Appalachians
- Central California
- Portions of the Southwest
- Great Lakes region watersheds

## Conservation Implications

### Climate Refugia Challenges

Federal lands traditionally serve as biodiversity refugia, but face challenges:

1. **Higher projected climate stress** on federal lands compared to other ownership types
2. **Limited ability to migrate** due to surrounding land use patterns
3. **Connectivity barriers** between protected areas

### Priority Conservation Areas

Based on biodiversity patterns and threat assessments:

1. **Mississippi River Basin**: High biodiversity, high land use stress
2. **Madrean Sky Islands**: High endemism, climate vulnerability
3. **Southeastern Coastal Plain**: High aquatic biodiversity, development pressure
4. **Great Lakes Region**: High stress, important migratory corridors

### Management Recommendations

1. **Enhance connectivity** between protected areas
2. **Prioritize watershed protection** in high-biodiversity regions
3. **Implement climate adaptation strategies** on federal lands
4. **Address grassland bird declines** through habitat restoration
5. **Control invasive species** in vulnerable ecosystems

## Summary and Implications

The biodiversity chapter reveals critical conservation challenges:

1. **Widespread Declines**: At least **20 percent** of all bird species and over **50 percent** of grassland and ground-nesting birds show population declines, indicating ecosystem-wide stress.

2. **Regional Hotspots**: The RPA South Region contains **63 percent** of endemic aquatic species, making it a critical conservation priority.

3. **Development Pressure**: Development emerges as the single largest stressor across all regions, highlighting the need for smart growth strategies.

4. **Climate Vulnerability**: Federal lands face higher projected climate stress, potentially compromising their role as biodiversity refugia.

5. **Compound Threats**: The intersection of land use change, climate stress, and invasive species creates complex conservation challenges requiring integrated management approaches.

6. **Aquatic Systems at Risk**: With the highest concentrations of imperiled fishes, crayfish, and mussels in the North and South Regions, watershed protection is critical.

These findings underscore the urgent need for landscape-scale conservation strategies that address multiple stressors, enhance habitat connectivity, and protect both terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity in the face of ongoing environmental change.
