## Introduction

The **2020 Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment** explores the present condition and 50-year outlook for the Nation's forest and rangeland resources. This chapter follows the organization of the resource-specific chapters (Chapters 4 through 11). Each section provides the key findings of the corresponding chapter, as well as the results that support those findings. Key findings apply to the conterminous United States unless otherwise specified.

## Land Resources

### Key Finding
> **Developed lands continue to encroach on natural ecosystems and agricultural areas, with about half of new developed lands converting from forest or rangeland.**

#### Development Trends (1982-2012)
- Developed land area exhibited the **largest net gains** of all land uses in all RPA regions
- Development was the primary driver of net changes in most nondeveloped land uses
- **~50%** of new developed lands converted from forest or rangeland
- Remainder converted from agriculture (crop and pasture) land uses
- Rate of transition to developed land:
  - **Increased**: 1982 to 1997
  - **Decreased**: After 1997 (though area continued to increase)

#### Future Projections
**Developed lands are projected to continue expanding in all scenarios, although less than projected in the 2010 RPA Assessment.**

Factors influencing expansion:
- **Larger expansion**: High socioeconomic growth scenarios
- **Smaller expansion**: Hotter climate futures
- **Regional differences**: Larger than within-region differences
- **Greatest increases**: RPA South Region
- **Smallest increases**: Pacific Coast and Rocky Mountain Regions

### Forest Land Trends

> **Forest land area increased slightly over past decades, mostly at expense of pasture and crop land areas. This trend is expected to shift to decreasing forest area under all scenarios.**

#### Historical Changes (1982-2012)
- Net gains from crop and pasture land offset forest losses to development
- Resulted in **slight net increase** in forest land area
- Regional patterns:
  - **North and South Regions**: Slight increase in non-Federal forest
  - **Rocky Mountain Region**: Stable
  - **Pacific Coast Region**: Slight decrease

#### Future Projections
- Privately owned forest land projected to decline
- **91%** of current privately owned forest projected to remain forest by 2070
- Net loss **35-55%** lower than 2010 Assessment projections
- Most loss will convert to developed land
- **Largest decreases**: South Region

### Forest Fragmentation

> **Forest cover fragmentation slowed over past decade but continues overall**

#### Recent Trends (2001-2016)
- Fragmentation increased in all RPA regions (but decreasing rate after 2006)
- **2.6%** net loss of forest cover resulted in **6.4%** net loss of "interior" forest
- Regional interior forest losses:
  - **South Region**: 2.7%
  - **Rocky Mountain Region**: 12.3%
- Stabilization/recovery in North and South Regions after 2006

#### Future Projections
Interior forest area projected to:
- **Decrease**: Most scenario-climate futures
- **Increase**: Under "hot" climate future
- **Gaining regions**: Northeast, North Central, South Central, Great Plains
- **Losing regions**: Pacific Southwest, Pacific Northwest, Intermountain, Southeast

### Forest Landscape Context

> **Most forest lands remain in "natural" landscapes, but increasing proportion expected in "interface" landscapes**

#### Current Status (2001-2016)
- **88%** of forest cover in natural-dominated landscapes
- **31%** in "interface" landscapes (≥10% developed/agriculture)
- Net decrease in natural-dominated area in all regions
- Net increase in developed-dominated and interface areas

### Land Use Drivers

> **Economic and regional factors tend to be more important drivers of land use area changes than climatic conditions**

Key insights:
- Socioeconomic factors > climatic factors for land use change
- Financial returns to developed/agricultural land often far exceed alternatives
- High-growth scenarios accelerate conversion regardless of climate
- Temperature rise dampens acceleration effect

## Disturbances to Forests and Rangelands

### Fire Trends

#### 2050-2070 Scenarios
- **Low demand/less forest loss**: Continued increase
- **High demand/increased forest loss**: Decrease but remain >2020 levels
- High demand scenarios: **39-46%** harvest increases support expanding forest products

### Carbon Dynamics

#### Domestic Water Use (2005-2015)
- Total use: **-10%** despite **+8%** population
- Per capita: **98 gallons/day** → **82 gallons/day**
- Surface freshwater withdrawals decreased in **64%** of counties

#### Sector Reductions
- **Irrigation**: -7%
- **Thermoelectric**: -34%

#### Conservation Drivers
- High-efficiency appliances
- Low-flow toilets
- Outdoor turf limitations

### Water Shortages

#### Current Conditions (1986-2015)
- Much of U.S. experienced moderate+ shortages
- High-intensity short-term shortages:
  - Southern Great Plains
  - Rocky Mountain Subregions
  - Southern California
  - Northern Florida

### Future Water Use Projections

> **National consumptive use projected to range from -9% to +235%, with agriculture driving largest impacts**

#### Projected Changes by Sector
- **Domestic**: -55% to +2%
- **Total consumptive**: -9% to +235%
- **Agriculture**: Accounts for 42% of withdrawals, drives aggregate changes

#### Regional Patterns
- **West**: Declining acres irrigated and water per acre
- **East**: Increasing irrigation for yield reliability

### Water Yield Projections

> **Mid-century water yield changes range from +25.7% (wet future) to -10.9% (dry future)**

- **Birds**: Florida and Hawaii hotspots
- **Fish, crayfish, mussels**: North and South Regions
- **Forest amphibians**: Greatest proportion possibly extinct/at-risk

### Land Use Stress

> **North and South Region watersheds most vulnerable to compounded land use stress. Development is largest stressor.**

#### Eastern U.S. Pressures
- Land conversion
- Population growth
- Agricultural expansion
- Energy infrastructure
- Mining
- Limited Federal lands as reserves

#### Western U.S. Pressures
- Concentrated near population/agricultural centers:
  - Washington

- Lower elevations: Southern NM, AZ, OK, TX
- High elevations experience more stress under hot vs. dry projections

### Federal Lands as Refugia

> **Federal lands under higher climate stress than other lands, potentially limiting refugia function**

#### Key Challenges
- National Forest System and National Park Service lands often at higher elevations
- Greater projected climate stress than surrounding areas
- Private land conversion to development limits alternatives
- Critical for imperiled species protection but effectiveness may decline

- **State parks**: 2.2+ million acres nationally
  - **North Region**: Greatest number of acres
- **Federal agencies**: 7 agencies, ~400 million acres
  - Most common in West but present in all regions
- **Private lands**: Less accessible, primarily for landowners
