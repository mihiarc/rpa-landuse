## Overview

The **2020 Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment** is the sixth report prepared in response to the mandate in the 1974 Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (P.L. 93-378, 88 Stat 475, as amended), which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to assess the Nation's renewable resources every 10 years.

### Purpose
The RPA Assessment is intended to provide reliable information on:
- Status, trends, and projected future of the Nation's renewable natural resources
- All forests and rangelands on a 10-year cycle
- Mid-cycle updates to decadal assessments (not required but prepared by USDA Forest Service)

### Focus Areas
The 2020 RPA Assessment examines:
- Past, current, and projected future availability and condition of:
  - Forests
  - Forest product markets
  - Rangelands
  - Water
  - Biodiversity
  - Outdoor recreation
- Effects of socioeconomic and climatic change upon these resources

> **The RPA legislation recognizes the importance of our forests and rangelands in contributing to the American public's well-being and quality of life.**

## Scope of the Analysis

### Research Framework
The RPA Assessment reports on targeted research funded by the USDA Forest Service to:
- Address the RPA legislative mandate
- Provide historical trends
- Project plausible futures of forest and rangeland resources
- Analyze influences of multiple drivers of change **50 years into the future**
- Inform planning to prevent resource degradation and shortage

### Coverage
The analyses respond to the mandated **national all-lands focus** and include:
- Renewable natural resources
- Related economic sectors for which USDA Forest Service has management responsibilities:
  - Forests
  - Forest products
  - Rangelands
  - Water
  - Biodiversity
  - Outdoor recreation

### Methodology
- Examine direct and indirect effects of socioeconomic and climatic change
- Incorporate demographic, economic, and climatic variables into models
- Target research to improve understanding of multiple interacting factors
- Provide coherent and integrated view of the future

### Partnerships
The RPA Assessment:
- Capitalizes on USDA Forest Service research capacity
- Draws upon expertise of other Federal agencies
- Relies on data from agencies like U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (water quality)
- References U.S. Department of Energy analyses (renewable energy, except wood-based bioenergy)
- Partners with university sector researchers

### Geographic Scope and Constraints
- **Primary focus**: National level
- **Data requirements**: Nationally consistent or compilable to national level
- **Limitations**: Often restricted to conterminous United States due to data constraints
- **Subnational analyses**: Conducted where appropriate (e.g., rangeland focus on Western U.S.)
- **Regional reporting**: Four RPA Assessment regions (Figure 2-1)
- **Scale terminology**: Clearly defined by specifying extent, resolution, or other characteristics

### Measurement Units
The Assessment uses a **hybrid approach**:

**Metric units** used for:
- Disturbance
- Forest Products
- Rangeland Resources
- Biodiversity
- Carbon accounting
- Water yield

**English units** used for:
- Land Resources
- Outdoor Recreation
- Forest area and volume reporting
- Water use

*Both units provided in Conclusions sections to meet all audience needs*

## Framing Context

### Key Drivers
> **Population, income, and climatic factors are all key drivers of resource demands that affect the future status of forests and rangelands**

Effects of drivers:
- **Increasing population and per capita income**: Increase demand for goods and services
- **Changing climatic factors**: Including increasing temperatures affect demand
- **Climate change**: Affects future condition and supply of resources with profound and variable impacts

### Scenario Approach
Following the 2010 RPA Assessment precedent:
- Uses scenarios to project resource futures
- Based on anticipated effects of changes in:
  - **Population and income** (county scale)
  - **Climate** (4-km² scale)
- Constructs range of scenarios by combining key driver assumptions
- Provides guidance on application

## Uncertainty and the Case for Scenarios

### Sources of Uncertainty
The need for scenario-based projections stems from uncertainties in:
- **Demography**
- **Economics**
- **Climate**
- **Natural resource effects**

### Recent Global Changes
**Trade and Economics**:
- Pre-2010: Growing trade liberalization
- 2007-2009 and 2020: Global recessions
- 2010s: Trade frictions, incomplete trade agreements
- Foreign direct investment changes
- U.S. wood products sector: Increased foreign investment

**Climate Policy**:
- **2016 Paris Agreement**: International treaty on climate change
- Forest sector considerations:
  - Climate mitigation through management
  - Wood for energy and building materials
  - Threats from altered disturbance patterns
- Impacts on ecosystem services, management costs, urban forests

### Scenario Approach
Given variability and uncertainties:
- Use set of scenarios for alternative plausible futures
- Strongly influenced by:
  - Population assumptions
  - Economic assumptions
  - Climate change projections
- **Not assigned likelihoods**
- **Not intended to be "accurate"**
- Provide means to understand interactions of:
  - Socioeconomic conditions
  - Climate conditions
  - Natural resource futures

### Future Outlook
**Population**: Projected to continue increasing globally and in most U.S. scenarios

**Economic growth**:
- Short-term: Uncertain
- Long-term: Expected positive but slower than recent decades

**Inequality**: Can rise or fall depending on how trends are managed

**RPA scenarios vary assumptions about**:
- Global economic growth
- Global wood energy consumption
- Forest products trade
- Domestic population and economic growth
- Global climate change

### Application
Managers and policymakers can use findings to:
- Evaluate ways to reduce likelihood of unwanted futures
- Increase chances for desired futures
- Assess alternative resource futures
- Identify challenges for renewable resource management
