## Key Findings

> Since the 2010 Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment, the forests of the United States have been affected by changes in disturbance rates, forest management (including forest harvesting and planting), forest ownership, and land use. At the same time, forests have continued to mature and provide a suite of ecosystem services.

### Major Forest Trends and Projections

- **Important forest types are expected to lose area** due to forest loss, conversion to planted pine following harvest, climate, and succession. These forest types include:
  - Aspen/birch in the North
  - Oak/gum/cypress in the South
  - Ponderosa pine in the Rocky Mountains
  - Hemlock/Sitka spruce in the Pacific Coast Region

- **Timberland growing stock volume is projected to increase through 2050**. Post-2050, growing stock volume trajectories depend on roundwood demand and land use choices.

- **Aboveground biomass carbon density** (carbon per unit area) is projected to increase by **17 to 25 percent** over 2020 densities by 2070, while annual carbon stock change is projected to decrease, indicating increasing carbon saturation of U.S. forests. The forest ecosystem is projected to become a net source of CO₂ by 2070 under futures that include high roundwood demand and net forest loss.

- **Projections suggest that harvested wood carbon annual stock change rates in 2070** will be greater than net forest ecosystem annual stock change rates under moderate and high growth future scenarios.

- **Although forest area increased 3.6 percent between 1977 and 2017**, forest area is projected to decrease between 2020 and 2070, with net losses primarily driven by conversion to developed uses.

- **There are an estimated 9.6 million family forest ownerships** across the United States, and they control more forest land than any other ownership category (**39 percent** excluding interior Alaska).

## Historical Trends in U.S. Forests

### Forest and Timberland Area

- **Forest and timberland area increased 3.6 percent from 1977 to 2017** but showed signs of decreasing from 2012 to 2017.

- Despite increases in forest area from 1977 to 2017, several forest types have decreased in extent, including:
  - **Lodgepole pine** and **ponderosa pine** types in the Western States
  - **Aspen/birch**, **longleaf/slash pine**, and **oak/pine** types in the Eastern States

### Growing Stock Volume

- **Growing stock volume on timberland increased 39 percent between 1977 and 2017**. The largest increases occurred in the **RPA North** and **South Regions**.

- Based on 2016 estimates, **average harvest removals from timberland for products have not recovered to pre-recession levels**.

### Forest Area Statistics (2017)

- Total forest area in the United States: **765 million acres**
- Timberland: **514 million acres**
- Conterminous United States forest area: **635.3 million acres** (increase from 612.4 million acres in 1977)
- Most forest land is timberland: **500.7 million acres in 2017** (**78.8 percent** of all forest land)

## Summary and Implications

The forest resources chapter reveals critical trends and projections for U.S. forests:

1. **Historical Growth**: Forest area increased **3.6 percent** from 1977 to 2017, with growing stock volume increasing **39 percent** during the same period.

2. **Future Challenges**: Despite historical gains, forest area is projected to decrease by 2070, with losses driven primarily by conversion to developed uses.

3. **Carbon Dynamics**: While carbon density per unit area is projected to increase, the forest ecosystem may become a net source of CO₂ by 2070 under certain scenarios, particularly those with high roundwood demand and net forest loss.

4. **Regional Variations**: Important forest types across all regions face threats from climate change, land use conversion, and succession dynamics.

5. **Ownership Patterns**: Family forest ownerships control the largest share of forest land (**39 percent**), highlighting the importance of private landowner decisions in forest conservation and management.

These findings underscore the need for strategic forest management policies that balance economic demands with ecosystem services, particularly in the face of climate change and increasing development pressures.
