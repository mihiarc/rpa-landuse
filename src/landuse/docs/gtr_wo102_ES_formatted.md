## Introduction

The **2020 Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment** is the sixth report prepared in response to the mandate in the 1974 Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (Public Law 93–378, 88 Stat 475, as amended).

This report addresses lands across all ownerships and summarizes findings about:
- Status, trends, and projected future of U.S. forests
- Forest product markets
- Rangelands
- Water resources
- Biodiversity
- Outdoor recreation
- Effects of socioeconomic and climatic change upon these resources

The results can inform resource managers and policymakers as they develop strategies to sustain natural resources. Important differences are found regionally and locally, and those unique patterns highlight the need for flexible adaptation and management strategies. The Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will continue to use the results to inform strategic planning and forest planning.

The 2020 RPA Assessment outlook for U.S. resources provides projected futures across **four RPA scenarios** that contain differing assumptions about:
- U.S. and global population and economic growth
- Technology change
- Bioenergy preferences
- Openness of international trade
- Wood-energy consumption
- Global climate change from 2020 to 2070

## Key Findings

### 1. Land Development Threats

> **Land development will continue to threaten the integrity of forest and rangeland ecosystems.**

#### Current Status and Projections
- Developed land use in the United States has continued expanding (though the expansion has slowed)
- Developed land area is projected to increase **42-58%** by 2070 (from 97.7 million acres in 2020)
- These increases occur at the expense of forests and rangelands

#### Regional Impacts
- **Greatest increases by 2070**: RPA South Region
- **Highest forest land loss**: RPA South Region
- **Highest rangeland loss**: Pacific Coast

#### Wildland-Urban Interface
- Increased by **33%** between 1990 and 2010
- Covered **10%** of all land and **14%** of forest land in 2010
- Area of landscapes dominated by developed land projected to increase **66-114%** between 2020 and 2070

#### Ecosystem Impacts
**Threats from Development:**
- Highest rates of nonnative plant invasion occur near developed areas
- Destruction of critical habitats
- Reduced connectivity among habitats
- Displacement or isolation of wildlife populations
- Increased long-term vulnerability to climate change
- Dominant threat to wildlife across most Eastern United States
- High risk near large urban areas in Western United States

**Resource Impacts:**
- Reduced carbon sequestration capacity
- Decreased wood and fiber production
- Limited recreational opportunities
- Compromised clean air and water provision
- Increased water stress in southern and western regions
- Declining per capita recreation availability

### 2. Climate and Disturbance Challenges

> **The combination and interaction of socioeconomic change, climate change, and the associated shifts in disturbances will strain natural resources and lead to increasing management and resource allocation challenges.**

#### Drought Projections by 2070
- More frequent occurrence
- Longer duration
- Greater intensity
- **Most affected regions**: RPA Rocky Mountain Region and southern Pacific Coast Region
- Fastest growing regions projected to become the driest

#### Water Management Challenges
- Limited effectiveness of reservoir storage increases
- Groundwater mining offers only short-term relief
- Increasing water transfers from agriculture to urban users

#### Rangeland Impacts
Recent drought effects observed in:
- Arizona
- New Mexico
- Southeast Colorado
- Northwest Texas
- Western Oklahoma
- Southwest Kansas

**Texas Example**: Severe drought (2011-2012) caused:
- Widespread rangeland production reductions
- Forest mortality

#### Wildfire Trends
- **2000-2017**: Average annual area burned more than **doubled** compared to 1984-1999
- Total high-severity fire area expected to increase by 2070
- Volume of fire-killed trees expected to increase

**Most Affected Forest Types:**
- Douglas-fir
- Ponderosa pine
- Pinyon/juniper forests
- Woodland hardwoods

#### Regional Vulnerabilities

**Rocky Mountain Region:**
- Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine projected to lose area, growing stock volume, and carbon
- Concerns about forest sustainability
- Impacts on wildlife, recreation, and forest product manufacturing

**Southern and Eastern United States:**
- Rising sea levels causing coastal forest transitions to saltwater marshes
- Increased pressure for inland development
- Higher demand for wood products for rebuilding

#### Carbon Dynamics
Current status:
- Forest growth offsets >10% of economy-wide carbon emissions annually

Future projections:
- Growth rates expected to slow due to:
  - Forest aging
  - Increased disturbance
  - Land use conversion
- Under high demand/high conversion scenarios: forests may become net carbon source

#### Biodiversity Stress

**North and South RPA Regions:**
- Highest current biodiversity
- Most vulnerable to land use change stress
- Limited federal land base for conservation refugia

**Pacific Coast and Rocky Mountain Regions:**
- Expansive federal lands
- High climate stress due to elevation
- Climate change may compromise refugia effectiveness

#### Recreation Pressures
- Stable per capita participation rates
- Growing total participation due to population growth
- Shrinking per capita forest recreation area by 2070
- High demand expected for developed recreation sites
- Infrastructure-dependent activities projected to see large gains

### 3. Management Solutions

> **Land management and adoption of conservation measures can reduce pressure on natural resources.**

#### Forest Management Strategies
- **Thinning and prescribed fire**: Effective at ameliorating drought impacts and reducing high-severity fires
- **Active forest management**: Improves forest growth and health
- **Forest plantations**: Focus timber production on smaller land base
- **Genetically improved planting stock**: Increases timber availability and reduces harvesting pressure

#### Water Conservation Success Stories
**2005-2015 Achievements:**
- Surface freshwater withdrawals decreased in **64%** of counties
- Domestic withdrawals fell **10%** despite **8%** population increase
- Irrigation withdrawals decreased **7%**
- Thermoelectric withdrawals decreased **34%**

**Key Technologies:**
- Low-flow toilets
- Turf removal incentives
- Efficient irrigation systems
- Advanced cooling methods for power plants

#### Policy Successes

**Clean Air Act Amendments (1990):**
- Substantial sulfur and nitrogen emissions reductions
- Highest reduction in North Region
- Ecosystem recovery from acid rain
- Improved wildlife habitat
- Species reintroduction (e.g., brook trout in Adirondacks)
- Projected continued reductions through 2070

#### Positive Trends
**Land Development:**
- Conversion rate to developed land declined after 1997
- Further decline after 2012
- Lower impact rate than previously projected

**Forest Fragmentation:**
- Rate of forest cover loss decreased after 2006 in all regions
- Interior forest area increased in South Region after 2006
- Projected increase in contiguous forest in:
  - South Central Subregion
  - Northeast Subregion
  - North Central Subregion

## Looking Forward

The RPA legislation recognizes the importance of forests and rangelands in contributing to American well-being and quality of life. Maintaining productive forests and rangelands requires:
- Continual monitoring and analysis
- Understanding effects of socioeconomic trends
- Adapting to climate change

### Future Challenges
Across all evaluated futures:
- Growing economy and land use shifts will increase resource pressures
- Greater demand for ecosystem goods and services
- Climate change and disturbances present new management challenges

### Opportunities for Action
- Negative effects portrayed are **not foregone conclusions**
- Timely actions can modify or reduce impacts
- Advanced management approaches from science and technology investments
- Recent technology changes have already reduced some resource pressures
- New opportunities for improved resource uses and management

### Complexity of Management
Forests and rangelands exist within dynamic contexts involving:
- Multiple land uses
- Various economic sectors
- Competing and changing resource demands
- Complex allocation decisions

The RPA Assessment provides crucial information for developing strategies to sustain the Nation's renewable natural resources by understanding:
- Multiple interacting factors creating current trends
- Expected future impacts on renewable resources
- Strategic planning opportunities for resource sustainability
