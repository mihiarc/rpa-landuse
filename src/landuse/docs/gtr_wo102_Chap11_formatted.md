## Key Findings

> Forests and rangelands, along with other natural resources and open space, provide opportunities for U.S. residents and visitors to participate in outdoor recreation. Recreation is a primary means through which people in the United States interact with these natural resources.

### Major Recreation Trends and Projections

- **Publicly managed recreation resources**, at all levels of government, provide most opportunities for outdoor recreation.

- **Per capita participation in outdoor recreation activities has been relatively stable** in recent years, but population growth has led to an increase in the number of participants.

- **Forest recreation resource availability, per capita, is expected to continue to decline** in future decades for locations experiencing population growth.

- **Greater income and population growth** generally result in higher rates of per capita participation in outdoor recreation.

- **Continued population growth results in a greater number of outdoor recreation participants**, even potentially offsetting any declines in per capita participation.

- **Greater atmospheric warming is projected to have a negative influence** on recreation engagement in many activities and little positive influence.

- **Projections of consumption**, measured as annual days of recreation, show increases across most activities, with the greatest numbers of recreation days in activities of a general or broadly accessible nature, i.e., day hiking, viewing nature, developed site use, and developed site camping.

## Outdoor Recreation Resources

### Key Resource Characteristics

- **Forests and other natural resources offer abundant public and private outdoor recreation opportunities**.

- **Data on the number and types of recreation resources** in the United States are limited, especially for local-government-managed lands and privately owned forests and rangelands.

- **Federal lands and Wilderness are disproportionately located in the West**, offering greater acreage under public management for outdoor recreation, especially in dispersed settings, undeveloped experiences unique to designated Wilderness, and national parks and associated areas managed by the U.S. National Park Service.

- **Private lands can offer unique recreation opportunities**, but those opportunities are often available only to owners and their friends and relatives or those who can purchase access.

- **Increased frequency and severity of disturbance** resulting from climate change may reduce the availability and condition of recreation opportunities.

## Regional Participation Projections

### Population and Participation Growth by Region

- **Pacific Coast**: Highest projected population growth, leading to substantial increases in total participants despite per capita declines in some activities
- **Rocky Mountain**: Moderate population growth with maintained per capita participation rates
- **North**: Slowest population growth but stable per capita participation
- **South**: High population growth driving increased total participation

---

## Summary and Implications

The outdoor recreation chapter reveals several critical trends and challenges:

1. **Public Land Importance**: Publicly managed lands provide the majority of outdoor recreation opportunities, with federal lands disproportionately located in the West.

2. **Population-Driven Growth**: Despite stable per capita participation rates, population growth drives increases in total recreation participants and demand.

3. **Climate Change Impacts**: Greater atmospheric warming is projected to negatively influence participation in many activities, particularly winter sports and summer heat-sensitive activities.

4. **Activity Shifts**: General and accessible activities (viewing nature, day hiking, developed site use) show the strongest growth projections.

5. **Regional Disparities**: Western regions have greater public land resources per capita, while Eastern regions face higher population pressure on limited resources.

6. **Demographic Variations**: Different racial and ethnic groups show varying preferences for outdoor activities, highlighting the need for diverse recreation opportunities.

7. **Resource Pressure**: Per capita forest recreation resource availability is expected to decline in areas experiencing population growth, potentially leading to crowding and resource degradation.

These findings underscore the need for:
- Strategic expansion of recreation opportunities, particularly near population centers
- Climate adaptation strategies for recreation infrastructure
- Inclusive planning that addresses diverse user preferences
- Enhanced partnerships between public and private landowners
- Investment in maintenance and capacity of existing recreation resources
