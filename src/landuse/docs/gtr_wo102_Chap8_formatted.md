## Key Findings

> Rangelands are areas where the natural vegetation is comprised principally of grasses, forbs, grass-like plants, and shrubs that are suitable for browsing or grazing, but the presence of herbivory is not a prerequisite for rangeland classification.

### Major Rangeland Trends and Projections

- **Rangeland health is relatively unchanged since the 2010 RPA Assessment**. The greatest overall impacts to rangeland health have been observed in the **RPA Pacific Coast Region** and in the southwestern part of the United States due to increases in invasive annual grasses and drought.

- **Rangeland production is increasing in the northern parts** of the rangeland extent and **decreasing in the South**, with corresponding changes in bare ground. Interannual variability in productivity is increasing in most areas at the same time, with the largest changes since 2000 having occurred in the Southwestern United States. Current production trends are projected to intensify in the future and become more variable on an interannual basis.

- **Rangelands have been steadily converted to developed and agricultural land uses**. Urbanization is projected to be responsible for most of the future reduction in rangeland extent, especially in the Pacific Coast Region.

## Rangeland Extent

### Historical Trends

- **The non-Federal rangeland base declined by 6 million hectares** (ha; **3.6 percent**) from 1982 to 2017, primarily driven by:
  - Net movement of **2.3 million ha** to developed uses (urban and rural transportation infrastructure)
  - **1.2 million ha** to cropland

- **Land area enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)** reached a national peak in 2007 of about **14.7 million ha**, followed by a steady decline to **9.1 million ha** in 2018, representing a loss of **38 percent**.

### Regional Distribution

Most of the rangeland area in the conterminous United States exists west of the 97th meridian. Key statistics include:

- **1982**: 169 million ha of non-Federal rangelands
- **2017**: 163 million ha of non-Federal rangelands
- **Net loss**: 6 million ha or **3.6 percent** (168,571 ha average loss per year)
- **Peak loss period**: 1982-1992 (3.6 million ha, 2.1 percent)

**Table 8-1.** Non-Federal rangeland area by RPA region.

## Summary and Implications

The rangeland resources chapter reveals several critical trends and challenges:

1. **Continued Area Loss**: Rangelands have experienced a **3.6 percent** decline since 1982, with urbanization projected to drive most future losses, especially in the Pacific Coast Region.

2. **Regional Productivity Shifts**: Northern rangelands are experiencing increased productivity while southern rangelands are declining, a trend expected to intensify with climate change.

3. **Invasive Species Threat**: Invasive annual grasses, particularly cheatgrass, pose significant threats to rangeland health, especially in the Great Basin and Intermountain West.

4. **Climate Change Impacts**: Projected changes include:
   - Earlier start and later end to growing seasons
   - Increased interannual variability in productivity
   - Shifts in suitable climate zones (climate analogs moving hundreds of kilometers)

5. **Management Challenges**: With **61.5 percent** of rangelands privately owned, coordinated management across ownership boundaries is essential for addressing landscape-scale challenges.

6. **Conservation Program Decline**: The **38 percent** reduction in CRP enrollment since 2007 represents a significant loss of conservation lands.

These findings underscore the need for adaptive management strategies that can address climate change impacts, invasive species, and land use pressures while maintaining the ecological and economic values of rangeland systems.
