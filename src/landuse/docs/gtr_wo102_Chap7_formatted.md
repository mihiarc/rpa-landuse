## Key Findings

> The United States and the world have undergone immense economic, social, and economic change over the 10 years since the last Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment, all of which have impacts on production and consumption of forest products.

### Major Market Trends and Projections

- **The future of U.S. markets is shaped by strong growth in emerging economies**, stable- to slightly-growing domestic demands, and by policy factors related to energy embedded in alternative scenarios. U.S. timber production and consumption are projected to remain strong with varying levels of growth across RPA scenarios, but with important changes in the product mix.

- **U.S. industrial roundwood production is projected to rise faster than derived product manufacturing demand**, resulting in the United States capturing a growing share of global industrial roundwood export markets.

- **The U.S. South is projected to remain the dominant timber producing region in the world** despite projected losses in forest area, producing around **10 percent** of total industrial roundwood under all RPA scenarios.

- **The U.S. paper sector has undergone a transition** related to declining demand for graphics paper and the shift in global markets to overseas paper production in the last 20 years that is projected to continue into the foreseeable future.

- **Overseas demand for hardwood roundwood and lumber** provides a base of support for domestic U.S. production.

- **Projected futures in the production and consumption of wood to generate energy** depend on policy assumptions and consumer preferences and vary widely by RPA scenario.

- **If current policies encouraging wood use in energy production are maintained in Europe**, the United States is projected to have a durable and growing wood pellet export market through 2070. Across all RPA scenarios, future pellet production does not exceed **4.2 percent** of total wood production.

## Historical Context

### Economic Recovery and Market Dynamics

In 2009, the United States was emerging from a deep economic recession, the effects of which were evident in production of industrial roundwood. The sharp contraction was due to:
- Substantial reductions in demand for wood for the construction sector
- Diminished demand for paper for most end-uses

U.S. consumption of wood products, primarily from roundwood, rose during the recovery, while paper products consumption continued the trend of long-term decline evident since the late 1990s. The negative paper consumption trend was led by:
- **Newsprint**
- **Printing and writing paper**

Due to substitution of electronic media. By 2019, total paper consumption levels still had not achieved rates observed in the late 1990s.

### Trade Dynamics (2017-2020)

From 2017 to 2020, the United States and its forest products sector were affected by:
- Increases in trade barriers on imports into the United States (particularly from Canada)
- Trade barriers on exports from this country to major trading partners (Europe and China)

## Market Projections

### Industrial Roundwood Production

Key projections for U.S. industrial roundwood production include:

1. **Production Growth**: U.S. industrial roundwood production is projected to rise faster than derived product manufacturing demand

2. **Export Market Share**: The United States is expected to capture a growing share of global industrial roundwood export markets

3. **Regional Dominance**: The U.S. South will remain the dominant timber-producing region globally, producing approximately **10 percent** of total industrial roundwood under all RPA scenarios

### Paper Sector Transformation

The U.S. paper sector continues to undergo significant transformation:

- **Declining Graphics Paper Demand**: Continued reduction in demand for traditional paper products
- **Global Market Shift**: Production shifting to overseas markets
- **Long-term Trend**: This transition, evident over the last 20 years, is projected to continue into the foreseeable future

### Wood Energy Markets

Wood energy production and consumption projections vary widely by RPA scenario:

1. **Policy Dependence**: Futures depend heavily on policy assumptions and consumer preferences

2. **European Market**: If current European policies encouraging wood use in energy production are maintained:
   - The United States is projected to have a durable and growing wood pellet export market through 2070
   - Future pellet production will not exceed **4.2 percent** of total wood production across all RPA scenarios

3. **Market Variability**: Wide variation in projections reflects uncertainty in:
   - Energy policy development
   - Consumer preferences
   - International market dynamics

### Hardwood Markets

- **International Support**: Overseas demand for hardwood roundwood and lumber provides a base of support for domestic U.S. production
- **Export Opportunities**: Strong international markets help maintain domestic hardwood production capacity

## Regional and Product-Specific Trends

### The U.S. South

Despite projected losses in forest area, the U.S. South is expected to:
- Maintain its position as the dominant timber-producing region globally
- Produce around **10 percent** of total industrial roundwood under all RPA scenarios
- Continue to lead in softwood production

### Product Mix Evolution

The forest products sector is experiencing important changes in product mix:
- **Traditional Products**: Stable to slight growth in lumber and panel products
- **Paper Products**: Continued decline in graphics paper
- **Energy Products**: Variable growth depending on policy scenarios
- **Export Products**: Growing importance of roundwood and pellet exports

## Summary and Implications

The forest products chapter reveals several critical trends shaping the future of U.S. forest product markets:

1. **Market Resilience**: Despite economic challenges and trade tensions, U.S. timber production and consumption are projected to remain strong across all RPA scenarios.

2. **Export Opportunities**: The United States is positioned to capture a growing share of global industrial roundwood export markets, particularly in wood pellets if European policies remain supportive.

3. **Sectoral Transformation**: The paper sector's ongoing transition away from graphics paper toward other products reflects broader technological and consumer preference changes.

4. **Regional Strength**: The U.S. South's continued dominance in global timber production demonstrates the region's competitive advantages despite environmental challenges.

5. **Policy Sensitivity**: Wood energy markets show high sensitivity to policy decisions, highlighting the importance of stable, long-term energy policies for market development.

6. **Product Diversification**: The changing product mix suggests opportunities for innovation and adaptation within the forest products industry.

These findings underscore the dynamic nature of forest product markets and the need for adaptive management strategies that can respond to changing global economic conditions, evolving consumer preferences, and policy developments.
