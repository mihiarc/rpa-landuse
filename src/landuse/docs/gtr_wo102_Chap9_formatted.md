## Key Findings

> In this chapter, we examine trends in freshwater use and supply throughout the conterminous United States and their implications for future shortages due to socioeconomic and climate change. We focus on renewable freshwater, which includes surface and subsurface flows, and provide projections of freshwater supply and likelihood of water shortage under future scenarios.

### Major Water Resource Trends and Projections

- **Both per capita water use and total water use are declining** in many parts of the country.

- **Despite reductions in water use**, many regions increasingly experience water shortages due to extended dry periods.

- **Projected changes in national consumptive water use** range from a **9-percent decrease** to a **235-percent increase**, with the largest impacts resulting from the needs of agriculture in response to climate change.

- **Changes in projected aggregate water yield by mid-century** range from a **25.7-percent increase** under a wet future to a **10.9-percent decrease** under a dry future.

- **Short-duration droughts are likely to turn into long-duration droughts**, and the intensity of drought is likely to increase substantially. Under higher future atmospheric warming, droughts lasting more than a year are projected to occur **four times more often** and increase in intensity by **76 percent**.

- **Adaptation options like increased reservoir storage have limited ability** to curtail shortage in the long term. Responses to climate change will probably require substantial transfers from agriculture to urban users, which could have serious negative impacts on rural communities.

## Water Sources and Forest Contributions

Key findings regarding water sources:

- **39 percent** of all water within the conterminous United States originates on forested lands
- Percentages are higher in the Eastern United States, where forests make up a larger share of the land base
- Relative shares of water from forests are lower in the Western United States, but the percentage that comes from national forests is much higher
- Roughly **60 million people** depend on forests for more than **50 percent** of their water supply

## Historical Water Use Trends

### Efficiency Gains

Among the most encouraging trends in water resources is the tremendous gains in water use efficiency:

- Water use in the United States **decreased 9 percent between 2010 and 2015**
- 2015 marked the **lowest level of water use since before 1970**
- This decrease came despite population increases

### Drivers of Efficiency

Efficiency gains have been achieved through:
- **Household appliances**: More water-efficient designs
- **Thermoelectric power generation**: Improved cooling technologies
- **Irrigated agriculture**: Better irrigation techniques
- **Structural economic changes**: Shift toward less water-intensive service industries over traditional manufacturing

## Water Use Projections

### Projection Methodology

**Table 9-1.** Principal drivers, rates of withdrawals, and climate feedbacks used in water use projections.

| Sector | Principal Driver | Withdrawal Rate | Climate Impacts |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Domestic** | Population | Gallons per capita | Changes in summertime temperature and precipitation |
| **Thermoelectric** | Population, total electricity use | Gallons per thermoelectric kWh produced using freshwater | Changes in temperature |
| **Irrigated agriculture** | Acres irrigated | Gallons per acre | Changes in temperature and precipitation |
| **Industrial and mining** | Personal income | Gallons per dollar income | None |
| **Livestock and aquaculture** | Population | Gallons per person | None |

### Climate Models

**Table 9-2.** Five climate models selected to reflect the range of the full set of 20 available climate models in the year 2070.

| Climate Projection | Climate Model | Institution |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Least warm | MRI-CGCM3 | Meteorological Research Institute, Japan |
| Hot | HadGEM2-ES | Met Office Hadley Centre, United Kingdom |
| Dry | IPSL-CM5A-MR | Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, France |
| Wet | CNRM-CM5 | National Centre of Meteorological Research, France |
| Middle | NorESM1-M | Norwegian Climate Center, Norway |

*Each model was run under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, providing a range of different U.S. climate projections.*

## Water Supply and Demand Projections

### Consumptive Water Use

Projected changes in national consumptive water use show extreme variability:
- **Minimum**: 9-percent decrease
- **Maximum**: 235-percent increase
- **Primary driver**: Agricultural water needs in response to climate change

### Water Yield Projections

Changes in projected aggregate water yield by mid-century:
- **Wet future scenario**: +25.7 percent increase
- **Dry future scenario**: -10.9 percent decrease

### Regional Variations

Water availability and demand projections vary significantly by region:
- **Eastern United States**: Generally higher water availability due to greater forest cover
- **Western United States**: Greater reliance on national forest watersheds for water supply
- **Arid regions**: Most vulnerable to increased shortages under climate change

---

## Drought Projections

### Drought Frequency and Duration

Under higher future atmospheric warming:
- Droughts lasting more than a year are projected to occur **four times more often**
- Drought intensity is projected to increase by **76 percent**
- Short-duration droughts are likely to evolve into long-duration droughts

### Regional Drought Impacts

- **Southwest**: Most vulnerable to increased drought frequency and intensity
- **Great Plains**: Significant increases in agricultural water stress
- **Southeast**: Increased variability in water availability despite generally adequate supplies

---

## Adaptation Challenges and Options

### Limited Effectiveness of Traditional Approaches

- **Reservoir storage**: Has limited ability to curtail shortage in the long term
- **Infrastructure improvements**: Cannot fully compensate for reduced water availability
- **Conservation measures**: While helpful, may be insufficient under extreme scenarios

### Necessary Adaptations

Responses to climate change will likely require:

1. **Water transfers**: Substantial transfers from agriculture to urban users
2. **Economic impacts**: Serious negative impacts on rural communities dependent on irrigated agriculture
3. **Policy changes**: New frameworks for water allocation and management
4. **Technology adoption**: Advanced irrigation systems and water recycling
5. **Land use changes**: Shifts in agricultural production to less water-intensive regions

## Forest-Water Connections

### Critical Statistics

- **39 percent** of all water in the conterminous United States originates on forested lands
- **60 million people** depend on forests for more than half their water supply
- National forests provide disproportionately high water yields in the Western United States

### Management Implications

The strong forest-water connection highlights the need to:
- Manage public and private forests for sustainable water resources
- Protect forested watersheds from conversion and degradation
- Consider water yield in forest management decisions
- Coordinate forest and water management across ownership boundaries

## Summary and Implications

The water resources chapter reveals both encouraging trends and serious challenges:

1. **Efficiency Success**: The United States has achieved remarkable water use efficiency gains, with total water use at its lowest level since before 1970 despite population growth.

2. **Climate Vulnerability**: Despite efficiency gains, climate change threatens water security through:
   - Increased drought frequency and intensity
   - Greater variability in water availability
   - Higher agricultural water demands

3. **Forest Importance**: With **39 percent** of U.S. water originating on forested lands, forest conservation is critical for water security.

4. **Adaptation Limits**: Traditional approaches like reservoir storage have limited effectiveness under climate change, requiring more transformative adaptations.

5. **Rural-Urban Tensions**: Necessary water transfers from agriculture to urban areas could have severe impacts on rural communities.

6. **Regional Disparities**: Water challenges will be most acute in already water-stressed regions, particularly the Southwest and Great Plains.

These findings underscore the need for integrated forest and water management strategies that can address both current efficiency opportunities and future climate challenges while balancing the needs of urban and rural communities.
