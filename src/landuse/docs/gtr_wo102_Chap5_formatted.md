## Key Findings

> **The annual area of fire in forests and rangelands has increased since 1984, and the average annual area burned from 2000 to 2017 was more than double the pre-2000 average.**

> **The two western RPA regions have generally had higher exposure to fire and drought than the eastern regions, as well as the greatest rates of tree mortality caused by insects and diseases. In contrast, forests in the RPA South Region have experienced the highest rates of removals.**

> **The highest rates of invasion by nonnative plants occur near agricultural or developed land uses, primarily in forests in the RPA South Region and portions of the North Region, as well as rangelands in the Pacific Coast Region.**

> **Fire-caused tree mortality in forests is expected to increase by 2070. The highest rates of fire mortality are expected if climate follows the hot or dry climate futures under any of the high warming RPA scenarios.**

> **Drought exposure for forests and rangelands is expected to increase by 2070, and forest and rangeland ecosystems in the Southwest are expected to experience the most substantial increases.**
