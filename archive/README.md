# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation and implementation notes that are preserved for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Purpose

Documents are moved to the archive when they:
- Document completed implementation work that is now integrated
- Provide historical context for past decisions
- Contain analysis of issues that have been resolved
- Are superseded by more current documentation

## Archived Documents

### Implementation Notes

**`implementation-notes/SCENARIO_QUERY_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md`**
- **Date**: Historical analysis of scenario query handling
- **Status**: Issue resolved, kept for reference
- **Superseded by**: Current agent implementation in `src/landuse/agents/`
- **Context**: Documents investigation into scenario naming and query patterns

## Using Archived Documents

Archived documents should be:
- ✅ **Referenced** when understanding historical decisions
- ✅ **Consulted** for implementation context
- ✅ **Preserved** as part of project history
- ❌ **Not updated** unless historically significant
- ❌ **Not linked** from current documentation (except as historical reference)

## Related Active Documentation

For current, actively maintained documentation, see:

- **[Main Documentation](../docs/)** - All active documentation
- **[Reference Documentation](../docs/reference/)** - Current technical references
- **[Development Documentation](../docs/development/)** - Active development guides
- **[UX Improvements](../docs/development/ux-improvements/)** - Current UX documentation

## Archive Policy

### When to Archive

Move documentation to archive when:
1. The implementation is complete and integrated
2. The issue or analysis is historical only
3. The document provides context but isn't needed for current work
4. Better, more current documentation exists

### When NOT to Archive

Keep documents active if they:
1. Are still referenced by current code or processes
2. Contain procedures or guides still in use
3. Document current architecture or design decisions
4. Provide essential reference information
