# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RPA Land Use Analytics project is an AI-powered analytics tool for analyzing USDA Forest Service RPA Assessment land use data. The system enables natural language querying of complex land use projections across 20 climate scenarios from 2012-2070, providing insights into agricultural transitions, urbanization patterns, and climate impacts on America's landscape.

The project combines modern AI/ML technologies (LangChain, GPT-4/Claude) with high-performance analytics (DuckDB) to make complex land use data accessible through natural language interfaces, interactive dashboards, and programmatic APIs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Language Query Interface

**User Story:** As a researcher or policy analyst, I want to ask questions about land use data in plain English, so that I can quickly get insights without writing SQL queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks "Which scenarios show the most agricultural land loss?" THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate SQL queries and return formatted results with scenario names and acres lost
2. WHEN a user asks about forest transitions THEN the system SHALL understand forest-related land use categories and provide relevant analysis
3. WHEN a user asks about geographic patterns THEN the system SHALL include state/county information in the analysis
4. WHEN a user provides ambiguous queries THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions or make reasonable assumptions and state them clearly
5. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and build upon previous queries

### Requirement 2: High-Performance Data Analytics

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want fast query execution on large datasets, so that I can perform interactive analysis without waiting for slow database operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying the 5.4M record fact table THEN the system SHALL return results within 5 seconds for typical analytical queries
2. WHEN processing aggregations across scenarios THEN the system SHALL leverage DuckDB's columnar storage for optimal performance
3. WHEN handling concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain query performance through connection pooling
4. WHEN executing complex joins THEN the system SHALL use the star schema design for efficient query execution
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and limits to prevent memory issues

### Requirement 3: Multi-Modal User Interfaces

**User Story:** As different types of users (researchers, policymakers, developers), I want multiple ways to interact with the system, so that I can use the interface that best fits my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing via command line THEN the system SHALL provide a rich terminal interface with colors, tables, and interactive prompts
2. WHEN accessing via web browser THEN the system SHALL provide a Streamlit dashboard with navigation, visualizations, and chat interface
3. WHEN integrating programmatically THEN the system SHALL provide Python APIs for batch processing and custom applications
4. WHEN using any interface THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality and data access
5. WHEN switching between interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent core capabilities

### Requirement 4: Climate Scenario Analysis

**User Story:** As a climate researcher, I want to compare different RCP/SSP scenarios, so that I can understand how different climate and socioeconomic pathways affect land use changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing scenarios THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between RCP4.5 (lower warming) and RCP8.5 (higher warming) pathways
2. WHEN analyzing socioeconomic impacts THEN the system SHALL differentiate between SSP1 (sustainability), SSP2 (middle-road), SSP3 (rivalry), and SSP5 (fossil-fueled) pathways
3. WHEN presenting scenario results THEN the system SHALL provide ensemble averages across the 5 climate models
4. WHEN showing projections THEN the system SHALL include confidence intervals or ranges where appropriate
5. WHEN explaining scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide context about what each scenario represents

### Requirement 5: Geographic Analysis Capabilities

**User Story:** As a regional planner, I want to analyze land use changes at different geographic scales, so that I can understand local, state, and regional patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying by geography THEN the system SHALL support county-level (FIPS codes), state-level, and regional analysis
2. WHEN displaying geographic results THEN the system SHALL include proper state names and geographic identifiers
3. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL support aggregation from county to state to regional levels
4. WHEN comparing regions THEN the system SHALL provide clear geographic context and boundaries
5. WHEN generating maps THEN the system SHALL create visualizations showing spatial patterns of land use change

### Requirement 6: Data Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security and data validation, so that the system is protected from malicious queries and data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all queries to prevent SQL injection
2. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. WHEN accessing the database THEN the system SHALL use read-only connections for user queries
4. WHEN handling API keys THEN the system SHALL securely manage and mask sensitive credentials
5. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL maintain security logs without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 7: Extensible Agent Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular agent system, so that I can extend functionality and integrate new capabilities without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new tools THEN the system SHALL support dynamic tool registration through the LangGraph architecture
2. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain separation between agent logic, tools, and data access
3. WHEN configuring agents THEN the system SHALL use centralized configuration management
4. WHEN handling different LLM providers THEN the system SHALL support both OpenAI and Anthropic models through factory patterns
5. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use memory-first architecture with conversation persistence

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL maintain >90% code coverage across all modules
2. WHEN testing database operations THEN the system SHALL include integration tests with real database connections
3. WHEN testing agents THEN the system SHALL mock LLM calls for consistent, fast unit tests
4. WHEN validating queries THEN the system SHALL test SQL generation and execution paths
