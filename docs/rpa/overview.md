# RPA Assessment Overview

## About the 2020 Resources Planning Act Assessment

The USDA Forest Service's 2020 Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment provides comprehensive projections of land use change across the United States through 2070. This assessment is mandated by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, which requires periodic evaluations of the Nation's renewable resources.

## Key Components

### Land Use Projections
The 2020 RPA Assessment includes detailed county-level projections for:
- **Private land only** - Public lands are assumed to remain static
- **5 land use categories**: Crop, Pasture, Rangeland, Forest, and Urban
- **3,075 US counties** - Complete coverage of the conterminous United States
- **Time periods**: 2012-2020, 2020-2030, 2030-2040, 2040-2050, 2050-2070, 2070-2090, 2090-2100

### Integrated Scenarios
The assessment uses 20 integrated climate-socioeconomic scenarios:
- **4 scenario combinations** (LM, HL, HM, HH)
- **5 climate models** representing different precipitation and temperature patterns
- **2 climate pathways** (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)
- **4 socioeconomic pathways** (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP5)

## Methodology Overview

### Econometric Model
- Calibrated using observed land use transitions from 2001-2012
- Based on National Resources Inventory (NRI) data
- Incorporates economic, demographic, and environmental drivers
- Projects future transitions based on historical relationships

### Key Assumptions
1. **Development irreversibility** - Once land becomes urban, it remains urban
2. **Private land focus** - Public lands excluded from transition modeling
3. **Policy-neutral** - Projections based on historical trends without future policy assumptions
4. **County-level resolution** - Maintains local geographic detail

## Data Sources

### Primary Data
- **National Resources Inventory (NRI)** - Historical land use observations
- **Climate projections** - From 5 global climate models
- **Socioeconomic projections** - Population and economic growth scenarios

### Model Outputs
- **Transition matrices** - Acres changing between land use categories
- **Scenario variations** - Results for all 20 integrated scenarios
- **Temporal resolution** - Decadal projections through 2100
