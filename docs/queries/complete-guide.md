    D --> E[Query Execution]
    E --> F[Result Formatting]
    F --> G[Natural Language Response]
```

### The Complete Process

1. **Language Understanding**: The agent analyzes your question to identify:
   - What data you're looking for
   - Which tables/fields are relevant
   - What filters or conditions to apply
   - How to aggregate or sort results

2. **SQL Generation**: Your question is converted to optimized SQL:
   - Proper table and column selection
   - JOIN operations when needed
   - WHERE clauses for filtering
   - GROUP BY for aggregations
   - ORDER BY for sorting

3. **Intelligent Response**: Results are formatted clearly with:
   - Summary of findings
   - Formatted tables
   - Relevant context
   - Follow-up suggestions

  WHERE scenario_name = 'RCP45_SSP1_Ref'
),
other_transitions AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT scenario_name, from_landuse_name, to_landuse_name 
  FROM v_landuse_with_metadata 
  WHERE scenario_name != 'RCP45_SSP1_Ref'

### Understanding Agent Responses

#### SQL Transparency

The agent shows the generated SQL query:

```sql
Query: SELECT scenario_name, year, SUM(acres) as total_forest
       FROM v_landuse_with_metadata
       WHERE from_landuse_name = 'Forest' 
         AND to_landuse_name = 'Forest'
       GROUP BY scenario_name, year
       ORDER BY scenario_name, year
```

This helps you:
- Verify the query matches your intent
- Learn SQL patterns
- Debug unexpected results

#### Result Interpretation

Results include:
- **Row count**: "Results: 245 rows"
- **Formatted data**: Tables with clear headers
- **Summary**: Key findings highlighted
- **Context**: Explanations of what the data represents

### Common Patterns

#### Time-Based Patterns

```
"between 2020 and 2050"
"in the year 2100"  
"by decade"
"over the entire period"
"changes from [year] to [year]"
```

#### Aggregation Patterns

```
"total area"
"average change"
"sum by scenario"
"count of transitions"
"percentage of total"
```

#### Filtering Patterns

```
"only in California" (state_fips = '06')
"excluding same-to-same transitions"
"where area > 1000"
"for Baseline scenario only"
"top 10 by [metric]"
```

### Advanced Techniques

#### Multi-Step Analysis

Break complex questions into steps:

```
You> First, find the counties with the most agricultural land
Agent> [Shows top agricultural counties]

You> Now show me how urban area changes in those counties
Agent> [Analyzes urban growth in previously identified counties]
```

#### Conditional Queries

Use conditions and logic:

```
"Show counties where forest loss exceeds 20% AND urban growth is above average"
"Find transitions that only occur in the High Crop Demand scenario"
"List counties with increasing cropland but decreasing pasture"
```

#### Custom Calculations

Request specific computations:

```
"Calculate the net change in agricultural land (crops + pasture) by decade"
"Show the ratio of urban growth to forest loss by county"
"What percentage of each county converts from natural to developed land?"
```

## Troubleshooting and Tips

### Best Practices

#### 1. Be Specific

❌ Vague: "Show me some data"
✅ Specific: "Show me forest to urban transitions in California for the Baseline scenario"

#### 2. Include Context

❌ Ambiguous: "What changes the most?"
✅ Clear: "Which land use type has the largest area change between 2020 and 2050?"

#### 3. Specify Filters

❌ Too broad: "Show transitions"
✅ Filtered: "Show transitions from agricultural land to urban in counties with FIPS starting with 06"

#### 4. Request Format

❌ Unclear format: "Give me the data"
✅ Clear format: "List the top 10 counties by forest loss, showing county FIPS and area lost"

### Tips for Success

#### 1. Start Simple

Begin with basic queries and add complexity:
- First: "Show forest data"
- Then: "Show forest data in 2050"  
- Finally: "Show forest to urban transitions in California in 2050"

#### 2. Use Natural Language

Don't try to write SQL-like queries:
- ❌ "SELECT * FROM landuse WHERE..."
- ✅ "Show me land use data where..."

#### 3. Ask for Clarification

If unsure about data:
```
You> What does the 'acres' column represent?
You> What's the difference between the scenarios?
```

#### 4. Build on Previous Queries

The agent remembers context:
```
You> Show me total forest area by year
[Agent shows results]
You> Now just show me the years where it decreases
```

### Best Practices for Complex Queries

1. **Break Down Complex Requests**
   - Start with simpler components
   - Build up to the full analysis
   - Verify each step

2. **Use Agent Memory**
   - Reference previous results
   - Build analyses incrementally
   - Save intermediate results

3. **Optimize for Performance**
   - Request samples for exploration
   - Use filtered subsets
   - Leverage indexed columns

4. **Validate Results**
   - Check totals and subtotals
   - Verify against known values
   - Look for logical consistency

### Query Optimization Tips

1. **Start broad, then narrow**
   - First: "What scenarios are available?"
   - Then: "Show forest changes in the Baseline scenario"

2. **Use table views wisely**
   - `v_landuse_with_metadata`: Complete denormalized view
   - `v_landuse_summary`: Pre-aggregated summaries
   - `v_scenario_comparison`: Cross-scenario analysis

3. **Leverage agent memory**
   - Previous results are remembered
   - Reference earlier queries: "Using those counties, now show..."

4. **Request appropriate limits**
   - "Show me a sample of 10 rows"
   - "List the top 20 counties"
   - "Summarize by decade instead of year"

### Practice Exercises

   - Show which scenario has the most forest

4. **Basic Comparisons**
   - Compare cropland between 2020 and 2050
   - Find the county with the most urban growth
   - Show the difference between scenarios

5. **Complex Analysis**
   - Build incrementally: Start simple, add complexity
   - Use context: Reference previous results
   - Be specific: Include scenarios, years, and regions
   - Think stepwise: Break complex analyses into steps
   - Verify results: Ask for row counts and sanity checks
