### Use Case: Real Estate Market Analysis

**Scenario:** Real estate developers need long-term market insights.

**Market Research Queries:**
```
You> Which counties will have the most urban growth pressure?

You> Show me areas transitioning from agricultural to urban use

You> Identify counties with limited developable land by 2050

You> Compare development potential across different scenarios
```

## 🏞️ Conservation Planning

### Use Case: Habitat Corridor Design

**Scenario:** Conservation organizations planning wildlife corridors.

**Connectivity Analysis:**
```
You> Show me forest fragmentation patterns over time

You> Which counties maintain the largest contiguous forest areas?

You> Identify critical linkages between protected areas threatened by development

You> Calculate habitat loss for forest-dependent species
```

**Conservation Strategy:**

- Conservation easement targeting
- Habitat restoration planning
- Species protection strategies

### Use Case: Biodiversity Hotspot Protection

**Scenario:** Protecting areas of high biodiversity value.

**Biodiversity Queries:**
```
You> Identify counties with diverse land use types that support biodiversity

You> Show me areas where multiple natural land types are converting to developed uses

You> Which scenario best maintains landscape heterogeneity?

You> Find counties where conservation could protect multiple ecosystem types
```

## 🌾 Agricultural Sustainability

### Use Case: Food Security Assessment

**Scenario:** State agricultural departments assessing future food production capacity.

**Food Security Analysis:**
```
You> Calculate total cropland availability by decade

You> Show me the balance between population growth and agricultural land

You> Which regions maintain the most productive agricultural land?

You> Identify counties at risk of losing critical agricultural infrastructure
```

**Policy Applications:**
- Farmland preservation programs
- Agricultural zoning policies
