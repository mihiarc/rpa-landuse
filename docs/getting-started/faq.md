# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about the LangChain Land Use Analysis system.

## General Questions

### What is this project?

The LangChain Land Use Analysis system allows you to query and analyze county-level land use projections using natural language. Instead of writing SQL, you can ask questions like "Show me forest loss in California" and get meaningful results.

### What data does it analyze?

The system analyzes USDA Forest Service RPA (Resources Planning Act) land use projections:
- **Coverage**: All US counties
- **Time Period**: 2020-2100
- **Scenarios**: Baseline, High Crop Demand, High Forest, High Urban
- **Land Types**: Crop, Pasture, Forest, Urban, Range

### Do I need to know SQL?

No! The agent converts your natural language questions into SQL automatically. You can ask questions in plain English like:
- "What counties have the most urban growth?"
- "Show me forest to cropland transitions"
- "Compare scenarios for agricultural land"

## Setup Questions

### What are the system requirements?

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: 2GB for data and dependencies
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **API Key**: OpenAI API key required

### How do I get an OpenAI API key?

1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/signup
2. Create an account
3. Go to API keys section
4. Create new secret key
5. Add to your `.env` file

### Which OpenAI model should I use?

```bash
# Recommended (best balance of speed and accuracy)
LANDUSE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Best accuracy (more expensive)
LANDUSE_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Alternative: Anthropic models
LANDUSE_MODEL=claude-3-sonnet-20240229
```

### Can I use it offline?

The data processing and queries work offline, but the natural language interpretation requires an internet connection to reach OpenAI's API.

## Data Questions

### What do the land use categories mean?

- **Crop**: Agricultural land for growing crops
- **Pasture**: Land for livestock grazing
- **Forest**: Wooded areas (natural and managed)
- **Urban**: Developed areas (cities, towns, infrastructure)
- **Range**: Natural grasslands and shrublands

### What's the difference between the tables?

| Table | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `landuse_transitions` | All transitions including same-to-same | Complete analysis |
| `landuse_transitions_ag` | Crop+Pasture combined as Agriculture | Simplified agricultural analysis |
| `landuse_changes_only` | Excludes unchanged land | Focus on actual changes |
| `landuse_changes_only_ag` | Changes with agricultural aggregation | Simplified change analysis |

### What scenarios are available?

1. **Baseline**: Most likely future based on current trends
2. **High Crop Demand**: Increased agricultural pressure
3. **High Forest**: Strong forest conservation
4. **High Urban**: Accelerated urbanization

### Why are areas in "1000 acres"?

This unit makes large numbers more manageable. To convert:
- Acres: multiply by 1,000
- Square miles: multiply by 1.5625
- Hectares: multiply by 404.686

## Usage Questions

### How do I start a query?

Simply run the agent and type your question:
```bash
uv run python scripts/agents/test_agent.py

You> Show me urban growth in Texas counties
```

### Can I export results?

Yes! Ask the agent to export:
```
You> Export the results to urban_growth_texas.csv
```

Supported formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet

### How do I query specific years?

Include the year in your question:
```
You> Show me forest area in 2050
You> Compare urban growth between 2030 and 2080
You> What changes happen in the 2040-2050 decade?
```

### Can I compare scenarios?

Yes! Ask comparison questions:
```
You> Compare forest area between all scenarios in 2100
You> Which scenario has the most agricultural land?
You> Show the difference between Baseline and High Urban
```

### How do I focus on specific counties?

Use FIPS codes or descriptions:
```
You> Show data for FIPS 06037 (Los Angeles)
You> Analyze California counties (FIPS starting with 06)
You> Focus on Midwest agricultural counties
```

## Technical Questions

### How does the natural language processing work?

1. Your question â†’ LangChain agent
2. Agent uses GPT model to understand intent
3. Generates appropriate SQL query
4. Executes query on database
5. Formats results in natural language

### Can I see the generated SQL?

Yes, the agent shows the SQL it generates:
```
Query: SELECT * FROM landuse_transitions WHERE ...
Results: 123 rows
[Table of results]
```

### How accurate is the SQL generation?

The GPT-4 models are very accurate for:
- Basic queries (>95% accuracy)
- Complex queries (>85% accuracy)
- Domain-specific terms (understands "forest loss", "urban growth", etc.)

### Can I write SQL directly?

Yes! Use this format:
```
You> Query database.db: SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition
```

### Is the data real-time?

No, this is projection data created by USDA models. It represents scenarios of possible futures, not real-time monitoring.

## Performance Questions

### Why is my query slow?

Common causes:
1. Large result sets - add limits
2. Complex aggregations - simplify query
3. Missing indexes - use indexed columns (scenario, year, fips)

### How can I make queries faster?

1. Use filtered tables (`_changes_only`)
2. Add LIMIT clauses
3. Filter by indexed columns first
4. Query specific years instead of all years

### What's the maximum file size I can process?

Default limit is 100MB (configurable):
```bash
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=200  # Increase limit
```

Large files are automatically sampled for preview.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Why does it say "Database not found"?

Run the data conversion first:
```bash
uv run python scripts/converters/convert_landuse_with_agriculture.py
```

### Why am I getting API key errors?

1. Check `.env` file exists in `config/`
2. Verify key starts with `sk-`
3. Ensure no extra quotes or spaces
4. Check API key is active on OpenAI

### Can I use a different LLM provider?

Currently supports OpenAI. The architecture allows for other providers (Claude, local models) with code modifications.

### How do I update the data?

Place new JSON data in `data/raw/` and run:
```bash
uv run python scripts/converters/convert_landuse_with_agriculture.py
```

## Advanced Questions

### Can I add custom tools?

Yes! See the [Contributing Guide](development/contributing.md) for instructions on adding tools to the agent.

### Can I modify the land use categories?

Yes, edit the `LAND_USE_MAP` in the converter scripts:
```python
LAND_USE_MAP = {
    'cr': 'Cropland',  # Change naming
    'new': 'NewCategory'  # Add categories
}
```

### Can I integrate this with other systems?

Yes! Options include:
- Python API for programmatic access
- Export functions for data pipelines
- Web service wrapper possible
- Jupyter notebook integration

### Can I use my own projections?

Yes, if your data follows the same JSON structure. See [Data Processing](data/processing.md) for format requirements.

## Best Practices Questions

### What makes a good query?

**Good queries are:**
- Specific: "Show forest loss in California between 2020-2050"
- Clear: Use standard terms (urban, forest, crop)
- Focused: One question at a time

**Avoid:**
- Vague: "Show me some data"
- Complex: Multiple unrelated questions
- Ambiguous: "What changes?" (which changes?)

### How should I explore the data?

1. Start broad: "What tables are available?"
2. Understand structure: "Describe the main table"
3. Look at samples: "Show me 10 example rows"
4. Focus analysis: "Now show me specific patterns"

### When should I use each table?

- **Full analysis**: Use base `landuse_transitions`
- **Change focus**: Use `landuse_changes_only`
- **Agricultural studies**: Use `_ag` tables
- **Performance critical**: Use filtered views
